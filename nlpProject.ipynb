There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near-akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal lateral segments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Recommend CABG evaluation CT CHEST: ___ 1. Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent residual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of direction of jet in mitral regurgitation. 2. Possible pulmonary hypertension. 3. Moderate coronary artery disease. CAROTID US: ___ No evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid stenosis on either side.

As you recall, you were admitted for shortness of breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, which caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve was weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart arteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac catheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your valve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are glad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs over 24 hours. \n",
